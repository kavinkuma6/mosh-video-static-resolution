Are you a fan(a.k.a student) of [Mosh Hamedani](https://twitter.com/moshhamedani)
and watching his videos using limited data plan?

Then you might have faced the below problem like me.

Do you change the resolution of the video every time to 360P or lesser than that 1080P(MAX) to save the data?

Then this extension will be helpful for you to make the resolution static.
